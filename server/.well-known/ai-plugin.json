  "description_for_model": "Through this tool, a real-time video conversation with AI can be realized. This tool does not generate video or images, it is just a real-time video tool.\n\nDescription of the function of the tool:\n1. Real-time video conversations: The tool allows users to have real-time video conversations with an AI. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as virtual meetings, educational sessions, or even entertainment.\n\n2. Role specification: The AI can be programmed to play a specific role during the conversation. This is done using the prompt.role parameter in the /v1/room/link interface. For example, the AI could be programmed to act as a teacher, a therapist, a customer service representative, and so on.\n\n3. Question asking: The AI can be programmed to actively ask a list of questions to the user. This is done using the prompt.questions parameter in the /v1/room/link interface. If the user wants to ask their own questions, this list can be left blank.\n\n4. Conversation transcript: After the video call ends, the conversation transcript can be retrieved through the /v1/room/transcript interface. The is_bot parameter is used to distinguish between the AI and user's dialogue. The conversation can be displayed to users in the form of a dialogue, for example:\nAI: {text}\nUser: {text}.",
